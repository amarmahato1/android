1.
Our CSP idea is mainly based on helping needy people. As we may all know, due to this lockdown many people in the country are facing economical crisis where they are forced to stay hungry. In order to help the needy ones, we are
planning to provide food for certain number of families until situations are normal.


2. Our small efforts will definetely make big differences. To be precise, we thought of helping at least 15 families of sukhipur village (Dalit Basti) and the needy families would get at least small help in feeding their family member for some days. With this service, we can help the families to have food in their home.

3. A community service program to end the hunger of the families of Sukhipur-08, Siraha Nepal. Due to the present condition, many people are not permited to earn for their living which have
caused economical crisis and resulted in  their health degrade. We can therefore help to provide them with meals for as many families we can.
